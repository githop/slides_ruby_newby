The next thing is to run this check on each * number 1 through 20. We need a range of integers, and one easy way to accomplish this is with the .upto(n) integer method. * 

This code issues the classic parental road trip warning. Rather than just printing the value of the current iteration, we need to be running our fizz and buzz checks inside the block.
