Ruby is known as a dynamically typed language. This means that we can play somewhat loose with our data types. For better or worse, a Ruby programmer doesn’t need to bother declaring a data type for each variable. A benefit of this is that our sum() or concatenate() method works on many data types out of the box, we just have to be conscious of what we’re expecting it to do for us. 

Certain programming languages have different rules on how you can use data types. Perhaps the code will only execute if each variable type is declared ahead of time, or certain methods expect a particular input. Ruby is not this way, due to it being dynamically typed. Otherwise, when defining sum, *it may have looked something like: 

def sum(int a, int b) 

This enforces that sum will only run if we input integers. In other words, it would not return “twotwo” if we fed it “two”, “two”. It would not run at all.
