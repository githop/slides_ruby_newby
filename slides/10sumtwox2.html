	**sum(“two”, “two”) #=> “twotwo”

If we do “two” + “two” in a Ruby interpreter we would get “twotwo”. That’s because when you give a ruby two “words” (read: strings) to add, *it’s going to concatenate them, rather than add them. The “+” method available to the string class invokes concatenation, not addition. *As far as strings are concerned, the plus “+”, or addition operator, when used with strings is akin to using a spreadsheet to merge two cells of text; such as first and last name.*
Perhaps we should redefine sum(a,b) as concatenate(a,b).
