Amongst the earliest things we learn in our academic careers are *the alphabet and counting. *Do you recall first learning the distinction between letters and numbers? *If our kindergarten selves were a computer program, we’d accept 2 data types: **numbers and letters. *(possibly play-doh as a mutable structure, but perhaps another time)

A data type is fundamentally a way to store information. Data types, in addition to a store of information, also have set parameters for what kind of information can be stored for a given type.

For instance:

If my kindergarten teacher were to ask me to count to 10, perhaps they would take exception if I were to begin reciting my ABCs… Even if I were a particularly smart cookie and begun spelling out the numbers (starting at zero, of course), I’d still be providing the wrong information for my teacher. The teacher asked for numbers, yet I wanted to show off my grammar skills..
