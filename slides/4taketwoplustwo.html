*Back to our simple expression, 

As far as Ruby is concerned, it would need a lot more information to accomplish the above task. Ruby can handle the word “two” and number 2, however they are not letters or numbers, *they are both in fact objects, one of class String and one of class Integer. Addition, as well as other math operations in Ruby, are indeed   *methods available to objects and can even be used with dot notation: 


2.+ 2 #=> 4 

*technically 2.class yields Fixnum ; for our purposes integers are fine
