This works great, but we can always improve. * This only works on single word palindromes, how about phrases? Simply reversing the string in this case will no longer work, * as phrases tend to have punctuation and palindromic phrases are allowed to have separate letter spacing as well. For example “A Toyota” is considered a palindrome, despite that
	
 “A Toyota”.downcase.reverse == “A Toyota”.downcase #=> false
