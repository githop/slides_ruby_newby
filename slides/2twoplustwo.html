If you read the sentence: 
</p>
<p>
“Two plus two.”
</p>
<p>
You probably think to yourself, *“Four, of course!”. That is because as humans, we are very loosely typed. We realize that “Two,”, “two”, and “four” are words that represent certain numbers. Even more, numbers have a way of being added together in a manner which yields a new number. In cases like above, we typically give the answer back as a word as well.
