With palindromes, the reverse method was key to our solution. For Fizzbuzz, we’ll be using modulus to do most of the heavy lifting. We used modulus to check if a number was even by seeing if it was a multiple of two. We

If we review our requirements, we should be able to use *	 

n % 3 == 0 #=> divides by 3
n % 5 == 0 #=> divides by 5 

to determine when we need to sub in “fizz” or “buzz”.
