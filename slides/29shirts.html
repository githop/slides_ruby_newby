<h2>Laundry Time!</h2>

<p>Integer division can be useful</p>

<p>How many shirts can I iron in 15 minutes?</p>
<p class="fragment">15 minutes</p>
<p class="fragment">4 minutes to iron a shirt</p>

<div class="fragment">
	<code>15 / 4 #=> 3</code>
</div>

<aside class="notes">

This could be the intended behavior, * perhaps I have 15 minutes available to iron laundered shirts and it takes me * 4 minutes to iron a shirt. How many shirts can I iron in this time? * 3 shirts. It’s safe to assume ironing a shirt ¾ of the way is not considered job well done.
