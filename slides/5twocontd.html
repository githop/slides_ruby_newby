We know *that “two” stands for 2 *and “plus” stands for addition, however Ruby needs to have “two” converted from a string to an integer to have access to the correct “+” method. Fortunately, most data types can be converted into *another with a conversion method. The one we would use in this case, would be :to_i, so:
</p>
<p>
“two”.to_i *#=> 0
</p>
Wait, that’s not right!
